For a simple watch face we want the current time spelled out in english. Write a function getTimeText(hour, minute) (or get_time_text(cls, h, m) for Python) that takes the time as two integers and returns the spelled out time as written below.

We would like the text to be simple to read, so we will round the current time to the next full 5 minutes (Definitely more convenient for the user than rounding down...). We will use a 12-hour clock (e.g. 13:00 is "one". For this particular clock we will not use "AM" and "PM", just the time (and let the user guess which half of the day it is ;-) )

The time will be passed in a 24-hour format, and may contain (0, 0) as well as (24, 0).

Examples

Time	Expected String
00:00	"midnight"
12:01	"five past noon"
01:05	"five past one"
13:06	"ten past one"
16:29	"half past four"
22:34	"twenty-five to eleven"
06:44	"quarter to seven"
07:56	"eight"
English time representation

As a reminder for all who are not that familiar with english names for the time:

During the first 30 minutes of an hour (m < 30), the time is measured from the current hour (m past h), afterwards we measure to the next hour (60-m to h). 00:00 is called midnight, 12:00 is called noon.
